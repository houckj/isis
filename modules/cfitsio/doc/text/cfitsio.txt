  1.  Introduction



  FITS <http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits.html> (Flexible
  Image Transport System) is a data format that is in widespread use by
  the astronomical community.  CFITSIO
  <http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/c/c_user/cfitsio.html>
  is a popular C library that interfaces to such files and provides
  support for all features of the format. Moreover CFITSIO supports a
  number of unofficial or proposed FITS conventions that are in
  widespread use.

  This package makes use of the CFITSIO library allow one to manipulate
  FITS files from the S-lang interpreter. The package consists of two
  interfaces: a high level interface and a low level one. The low level
  interface is implemented as a module and is more or less a
  straightforward wrapping of the functions of the CFITSIO library.
  Functions from this interface are prefixed with an underscore to
  indicate that they are part of the low-level interface.  The high
  level interface is written in S-lang and makes use of functions from
  the low level interface. While there is some overlap with the
  semantics of the CFITSIO library, the high level interface should be
  regarded as a separate interface to fits files.

  To illustrate the difference between the two interfaces, consider the
  low-level _fits_read_col function and its high level counterpart
  fits_read_col. The low-level function reads a single column, specified
  via the column number, from a fits binary table and performs a minimal
  amount of error checking. In contrast, fits_read_col is a high level
  function that reads one or more columns, specified either as column
  numbers or named columns, from a table and does so in a way that takes
  into account the way CFITSIO performs buffering for maximum
  efficiency. Moreover, the high level function checks for the presence
  of TDIM keywords or columns to give the arrays it returns the proper
  dimensionality. If any errors occur, the function will throw an
  exception.



  2.  The high-level interface



  2.1.  Overview



  The high-level interface consists of a number of functions that are
  written in S-lang and are designed to take some of the tedium out of
  performing standard operations on fits files. To illustrate this
  point, consider the creation of a fits file with a binary table
  extension called called ``COSXSINX'':


           variable data = struct { x, cosx, sinx };
           data.x = [0:2*PI:0.01];
           data.cosx = cos(data.x);
           data.sinx = sin(data.x);
           fits_write_binary_table ("foo.fits", "COSXSINX", data);



  It can't get much easier than that!



  2.2.  Opening and Closing Files



  In general the high-level functions take an argument that represents
  the fits file to be manipulated. It may be either an already open file
  pointer such as one returned by fits_open_file, or the name of a file
  to be opened. In the documentation for the functions, this fact is
  indicated by


            Fits_File_Type or String_Type fd;



  showing that the file descriptor may be either an open file pointer or
  a string.

  If specified as a string, then a fits file of that name will be opened
  in a mode that is compatible with the operation being performed, with
  the current HDU (header-data unit) set to the first ``most
  interesting'' one. Here, ``first most interesting'' means the first
  HDU with a non-zero value for the NAXIS keyword.

  For example, sometimes one simply wants to read some keywords from a
  file. In such a case it is not necessary to explicitly call
  fits_open_file. Rather simply pass the name of the file to the
  appropriate function:


           (object, ra_targ, dec_targ)
              = fits_read_key ("foo.fits", "OBJECT", "RA_TARG", "DEC_TARG");



  It may be necessary to specify which HDU should be used if the ``first
  most interesting'' one is not the desired HDU. The easiest way to do
  that is to specify the extension using CFITSIO's virtual file syntax,
  e.g.,


           (object, ra_targ, dec_targ)
              = fits_read_key ("foo.fits+1", "OBJECT", "RA_TARG", "DEC_TARG");
           (object, ra_targ, dec_targ)
              = fits_read_key ("foo.fits[EVENTS]", "OBJECT", "RA_TARG", "DEC_TARG");



  If one is going to make a number of calls to functions in the high-
  level interface using the same file, then it is a good idea to
  explicitly open the file, e.g.,


           fptr = fits_open_file ("foo.fits[EVENTS]", "w");



  opens the file for both reading and writing and sets the current HDU
  to the ``EVENTS'' extension.

  The object returned by the fits_open_file function is an object of
  type Fits_File_Type. It is automatically destroyed when it goes out of
  scope. When this happens, the fits file attached to it will be
  silently closed. Consider:


            define write_image_to_file (file, img)
            {
               variable fptr = fits_open_file ("new.fits", "c");
               fits_write_image (fptr, NULL, img, NULL, NULL);
               fits_write_date (fptr);
            }



  Here, the write_image_to_file function will create a new file called
  new.fits and write the specified image to the file. In this example,
  the file pointer object was not explicitly closed.  Since the fptr
  variable goes out of scope when the function returns, the cfitsio mod-
  ule will silently close the file. While this is a convenient feature
  for many purposes, it is always better to explicitly close a file when
  it has been modified. The reason for this is that CFITSIO writes to
  internal buffers and then flushes those to the disk. Often some
  buffers will not get written to the disk until the file is closed. If
  the disk is full, or something else goes wrong then the file will not
  be properly closed resulting in a incomplete or corrupt file. Hence it
  is strongly recommended that one explicitly close a file after writing
  to a file, i.e.,


            define write_image_to_file (file, img)
            {
               variable fptr = fits_open_file ("new.fits", "c");
               fits_write_image (fptr, NULL, img, NULL, NULL);
               fits_write_date (fptr);
               fits_close_file (fptr);
            }

  2.3.  Keywords


  The high-level interface contains several functions for manipulating
  header keywords and records.


  2.3.1.  Reading Header Keywords



  The fits_read_key may be used to read the values of one or more
  keywords. Suppose that the file casA.fits contains the following
  keywords in an extension called ``EVENTS'':


           TELESCOP= 'CHANDRA ' / Telescope
           INSTRUME= 'ACIS    ' / Instrument
           DETNAM  = 'ACIS-7  ' / Detector
           GRATING = 'NONE    ' / Grating
           OBJECT  = 'CAS A   ' / Source name
           RA_NOM  =     350.91781217089 / Nominal RA
           DEC_NOM =     58.792819089577 / Nominal Dec
           ROLL_NOM=     323.38710408328 / Nominal Roll



  The fits_read_key function may be used to read, e.g, the OBJECT and
  RA_NOM keywords:


            (obj, ra) = fits_read_key ("casA.fits[EVENTS]", "OBJECT", "RA_NOM");



  After the function call, the variables obj and ra will have the data
  types String_Type and Double_Type, resp.  If the requested keyword
  does not exist in the header, the function will return NULL to signal
  its not existence:


            exptime = fits_read_key ("casA.fits[EVENTS]", "EXPTIME");
            if (exptime == NULL)
              {
                 message ("*** Warning: EXPTIME does not exist.  Assuming 3.2);
                 exptime = 3.2;
              }



  The fits_read_key_struct is an alternative to fits_read_key that
  returns a structure with field names that correspond to the keyword
  names. In most cases, a field name will just be the lower case version
  of the keyword name. However, if the keyword name does not start with
  an alphabetic character or contains a hyphen, then it will be
  normalized as follows:

  1. The keyword name will be lowercased.

  2. All non-alphanumeric characters will be changed to an underscore.

  3. If the first character of the resulting name is numeric, then the
     name will be prefixed with an underscore.
     To illustrate the normalization process, consider:


            keys = fits_read_key_struct ("foo.fits", "OBJECT", "2CRVL3",
                                         "DATE-OBS");



  After the function call, keys will be a structure with the 3 fields:
  object, _2crvl3, and date_obs. If any of these keywords do not exist
  in the header, the value of the corresponding structure field will be
  NULL.



  2.3.2.  Writing Header Keywords



  The fits_update_key function may be used to write or update the value
  of a keyword. If a keyword of the specified name exists, then the
  value of the keyword will be updated to the new value.  Otherwise a
  new keyword will be appended to the header.

  Other specialized keyword writing routines include fits_write_date,
  which write the current date in the required format, and
  fits_write_chksum, which computes and updates the checksum of the HDU.
  Finally the fits_write_comment and fits_write_history functions may be
  used to write comments and history records to the header,
  respectively.



  2.4.  Binary Tables



  2.4.1.  Reading Binary Tables



  There are a several functions for reading binary tables. The simplest
  one, fits_read_table reads the entire binary table into a structure,
  whose fields correspond to the names of the columns in the table. (If
  a column has a name that contains non-alphanumeric characters, or does
  not start with an alphabetic character, then the structure field name
  for the column will be undergo the normalization process described for
  keywords.) For example, consider a file called foo.fits with a binary
  table whose structure is defined by the FITS header:



     XTENSION= 'BINTABLE'
     BITPIX  =                   8
     NAXIS   =                   2
     NAXIS1  =                  34
     NAXIS2  =                 500
     PCOUNT  =                   0
     GCOUNT  =                   1
     TFIELDS =                   4
     TTYPE1  = 'TIME    '
     TFORM1  = 'D       '
     TTYPE2  = 'X       '
     TFORM2  = 'E       '
     TTYPE3  = 'Y       '
     TFORM3  = 'E       '
     TTYPE4  = 'PHAS    '
     TFORM4  = '9I      '
     EXTNAME = 'EXAMPLE '
     TDIM4   = '(3,3)   '



  This header shows that the binary table is 500 rows in length and con-
  tains 4 columns with names TIME, X, Y, and PHAS. The table may be read
  via


          tbl = fits_read_table ("foo.fits[EXAMPLE]");



  assigning a structure to the tbl variable. The structure has fields
  with names time, x, y, and phas, which be displayed via


          vmessage ("tbl.time = %S", tbl.time);
          vmessage ("tbl.x = %S", tbl.x);
          vmessage ("tbl.y = %S", tbl.y);
          vmessage ("tbl.phas = %S", tbl.y);



  producing:


          tbl.time = Double_Type[500]
          tbl.x = Float_Type[500]
          tbl.y = Float_Type[500]
          tbl.z = Short_Type[500,3,3]



  Note that the fits_read_table function not only read the data in a way
  that preserved the data type, but it also correctly identified the
  phas column as one containing a 3x3 image in every row!

  Often one is interested in only a few columns of a table. Instead of
  reading the entire table, which could use a lot of memory for a large
  table, the fits_read_table function may also be used to read just the
  specified columns, e.g.,



      tbl = fits_read_table ("foo.fits[EXAMPLE]", "x", "y");



  will read just the X and Y columns.

  An alternative interface with much the same functionality is provided
  by the fits_read_col function. Instead of returning the data as a
  structure, it returns the data as multiple return values, e.g.,


          t = fits_read_col ("foo.fits[EXAMPLE]", "time");
          (x,y) = fits_read_col ("foo.fits[EXAMPLE]", "x", "y");



  The fits_read_cell function may be used to read a single cell in the
  table. For example


          phas = fits_read_cell ("foo.fits[EXAMPLE]", "phas", 4);



  will return the 3x3 array of the ``phas'' column in the fourth row.
  Finally, the fits_read_cells function may be used to read a specified
  range of rows in the table. For instance,


          (x,y) = fits_read_cells ("foo.fits[EXAMPLE]", "x", "y", 1, 1000);



  will read the first 1000 rows of the X and Y columns in the table.



  2.4.2.  Writing Binary Tables



  The high-level interface has several functions that are useful for the
  creation of a binary table. Chief among them is the
  fits_write_binary_table function, which supports several methods of
  calling it. The simplest use was illustrated earlier.  Here more
  complicated uses will be considered.

  As a first step, suppose that the binary table is to contain data for
  the Lissajous curve constructed as follows:


           A_x = 10.0; omega_x = 3.0;  phi_x = 0.0;
           A_y = 20.0; omega_y = 7.0;  phi_y = 1.0;
           t = [0:100:0.01];
           x = A_x * cos (omega_x*t + phi_x);
           y = A_y * cos (omega_y*t + phi_y);



  The goal is to write out arrays t, x, and y to a binary table called
  LISSAJOUS, and with columns of the corresponding names. The easiest
  way is to use:


           data = struct {t, x, y}; data.t = t; data.x = x; data.y = y;
           fits_write_binary_table ("foo.fits", "LISSAJOUS", data);



  Now suppose that it is desired to write the parameters defining the
  Lissajous pattern as keywords and to write a history record to the
  file. One way to do this is via the fits_update_key, fits_write_his-
  tory, and fits_write_comment functions:


           fp = fits_open_file ("foo.fits[LISSAJOUS]");
           fits_write_comment (fp, "This table contains data for a Lissajous pattern");
           fits_update_key (fp, "A_X", A_x, "x(t) Amplitude");
           fits_update_key (fp, "A_Y", A_y, "y(t) Amplitude");
           fits_update_key (fp, "OMEGA_X", omega_x, "x(t) omega");
           fits_update_key (fp, "OMEGA_Y", omega_y, "y(t) omega");
           fits_update_key (fp, "PHI_X", phi_x, "x(t) phase");
           fits_update_key (fp, "PHI_Y", phi_y, "y(t) phase");
           fits_write_history (fp, "This was written as an example for the " +
                                   "documentation of the slang cfitsio module");
           fits_close_file (fp);



  The advantage of using the fits_update_key is that it allows control
  over the comment associated with the keyword; however, repeated calls
  to fits_update_key can become tedious.

  A simpler mechanism to achieve this goal is to pass the keywords and
  history information to the fits_write_binary_table function as an
  optional arguments,


           keys = struct {A_x, omega_x, phi_x, A_y, omega_y, phi_y};
           set_struct_fields (keys, A_x, omega_x, phi_x, A_y, omega_y, phi_y);
           hist = struct {history, comment};
           hist.comment = "This table contains data for a Lissajous pattern";
           hist.history = "This was written as an example for the " +
                           "documentation of the slang cfitsio module";
           fits_write_binary_table ("foo.fits", "LISSAJOUS", data, keys, hist);



  to produce:

      COMMENT This table contains data for a Lissajous pattern
      HISTORY This was written as an example for the documentation of the slang cfitsi
      HISTORY o module



  It is important to note that in the the above examples, the name of
  the file to contain the binary table was explicitly passed to the
  fits_write_binary_table function. This causes fits_write_binary_table
  to create a new file containing the binary table, and if a file of
  that name exists, it will be deleted before the new one is created.

  To append a table to an existing file, first open it using the
  fits_open_file function, and then use the file pointer in place of the
  name:


            fp = fits_open_file ("foo.fits", "w");   % <<-- note the "w"
               .
               .
            fits_write_binary_table (fp, ....);
            fits_close_file (fp);



  This technique must also be used to create a file containing multiple
  binary tables:


            fp = fits_open_file ("foo.fits", "c");   % <<-- note the "c"
               .
               .
            fits_write_binary_table (fp, ....);      % first table
               .
               .
            fits_write_binary_table (fp, ....);      % second table
            fits_close_file (fp);



  2.5.  Images



  2.5.1.  Preliminaries



  Dealing with FITS images in S-lang is easy as long as one understands
  that FITS stores images in FORTRAN column-major order, whereas S-lang
  utilizes a C row-major order. That is, the first dimension of a FITS
  array varies fastest whereas it is the last dimension of a S-lang
  array that varies fastest. This difference is automatically accounted
  for by the underlying cfitsio module. In other words, images may be
  used in S-lang scope as ordinary S-lang arrays where the first
  dimension varies slowest, and the cfitsio module will make the
  necessary translations when reading or writing an image from a file.
  An easy way to remember the S-lang or C ordering is that for a 2-d
  array, the first index is a row index and the second a column--- the
  same as matrices are indexed in linear algebra. Do not fall into the
  trap of indexing a S-lang array the same as you would of indexing a
  point in Cartesian space (x,y), instead think in terms of rows and
  columns.



  2.5.2.  Reading and Writing Images



  The fits_read_img may be used to read the image from the primary FITS
  HDU or a FITS image extension. It is not designed to read images that
  are stored in binary tables--- there are other functions for that
  purpose. The fits_read_img function simply returns the data as an
  array of the appropriate type and dimensions (in row-major order) with
  any scaling defined via the BZERO and BSCALE header keywords applied.

  Writing an image HDU is somewhat more involved than reading one
  because in addition to writing the image data, the header must first
  be set up to describe the image. Fortunately, the high-level functions
  make this easy.

  Suppose that one has created an image array via, e.g., the histogram
  module's hist2d function from the X and Y columns of a binary table:


           (x,y) = fits_read_col ("evt2.fits[EVENTS]", "X","Y");
           xgrid = 3840.5 + [0:1023:2];
           ygrid = 3840.5 + [0:1023:2];
           img = hist2d (y, x, ygrid, xgrid);



  and that one wants to write this out to a fits file called img.fits.
  The simplest way to do this is using fits_write_image_hdu:


           fits_write_image_hdu ("img.fits", NULL, img);



  Note that the data-type of the image array controls the type of image
  written to the fits file. If the image array is an array of
  Double_Types, then the image will be written with BITPIX set to -64.
  To have such an array out as 16 bit integers, then the array must
  first be scaled to the range of a 16 bit integer and then typecast to
  Int16_Type:


           int16_image = typecast (img, Int16_Type);



  Additional keywords may be written to the image HDU using the
  fits_update_key function. And like fits_write_binary_table, the
  fits_write_image_hdu function takes optional parameters that specify
  additional keywords, history, and comments to be written. The reader
  is referred to the discussion of the fits_write_binary_table function
  for more information.



  2.6.  WCS Routines



  2.6.1.  Introduction


  The FITS package includes a set of routines for reading and writing
  WCS <http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_wcs.html> keywords in the form
  proposed by Greisen and Calabretta
  <http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/wcs.pdf>.  Although they
  are part of the high-level interface, the routines are somewhat
  experimental and as such must be loaded separately via:


           require ("fitswcs");



  The routines in this interface deal with a structure that describes
  the WCS via the following fields:

     naxis
        The number of axes to transform (Int_Type)

     ctype
        Specifies the WCS transformation (String_Type[naxis])

     cunit
        Units (String_Type[naxis])

     crval
        WCS values at the reference pixel (Double_Type[naxis])

     crpix
        The coordinates of the reference pixel (Double_Type[naxis])

     cdelt
        Species the gradient at the reference pixel (Double_Type[naxis])


     pc An array used to linearly transform the WCS.
        (Double_Type[naxis,naxis] or NULL)

     pv An array of addition parameters used to specify the WCS (NULL in
        most cases)

     ps An array of additional string parameters (NULL in most cases).

     wcsname
        A name given to this coordinate system.

  While the user is encouraged to understand the FITS WCS conventions
  and the precise meanings of these fields, the fitswcs interface
  provides routines to make the use of this structure as transparent as
  possible for the most common uses. A few examples will illustrate
  this.


  2.6.2.  Examples


  Consider once again the example of creating a FITS image by binning
  two columns of a FITS binary table:


           (x,y) = fits_read_col ("evt2.fits[EVENTS]", "X","Y");
           xgrid = 3840.5 + [0:1023:2];
           ygrid = 3840.5 + [0:1023:2];
           img = hist2d (y, x, ygrid, xgrid);
           fits_write_image_hdu ("img.fits", NULL, img);



  Unfortunately the resulting file will contain none of the WCS informa-
  tion that was attached to the X and Y columns from which the image was
  constructed. One might be tempted to simply copy that information to
  the output file with the aid of the fitswcs routines via


           wcs = fitswcs_get_column_wcs ("evt2.fits[EVENTS]", ["Y", "X"]);
           fitswcs_put_img_wcs ("img.fits", wcs);



  The problem with this approach is that the WCS read from the binary
  table does not describe the image created from it because it knows
  nothing about how the image was binned nor how the image pixel coordi-
  nates relate back to the X and Y columns. That information is con-
  tained in the definition of the grids passed to the hist2d function:


           xgrid = 3840.5 + [0:1023:2];
           ygrid = 3840.5 + [0:1023:2];



  These grids describe a simple linear transformation from image pixel
  coordinates to the (X,Y) coordinates of the binary table. Since the
  transformation is linear, the fitswcs_bin_wcs function may be used to
  transform the WCS:



      wcs = fitswcs_bin_wcs (wcs, ygrid, xgrid);



  It is the transformed WCS that is to be written out:


           fitswcs_put_img_wcs ("img.fits", wcs);



  It is important to note the order in which the X and Y arguments were
  used. Recall that FITS stores images in a FORTRAN column-major order
  whereas S-lang uses a row-major order. For this reason, ``row-like''
  parameters come before ``column-like'' parameters in statements such
  as


           img = hist2d (y, x, ygrid, xgrid);
           wcs = fitswcs_get_column_wcs ("evt2.fits[EVENTS]", ["Y", "X"]);
           wcs = fitswcs_bin_wcs (wcs, ygrid, xgrid);



  2.6.3.  Alternate WCS


  Sometimes it is useful to attach more than one coordinate system to an
  image. For example, it is useful to have a coordinate system that maps
  the pixel coordinates back to (X,Y) coordinates from which they were
  derived. The fitswcs_new_img_wcs may be used to construct a linear WCS
  corresponding to the linear coordinate grids of the image:


           wcsP = fitswcs_new_img_wcs (ygrid, xgrid);
           wcsP.wcsname = "PHYSICAL";
           fitswcs_put_img_wcs ("img.fits", wcsP, 'P');



  Note that the WCS was given the name ``PHYSICAL''. While not required,
  this enables this alternate coordinate system to be displayed as the
  physical system by the DS9 image display program.


  2.6.4.  Degenerate Axes


  Consider a FITS file hydra.fits containing an image HDU with the
  following FITS header:



      SIMPLE  =                   T / file does conform to FITS standard
      BITPIX  =                 -32 / number of bits per data pixel
      NAXIS   =                   4 / number of data axes
      NAXIS1  =                 657 / length of data axis
      NAXIS2  =                 657 / length of data axis
      NAXIS3  =                   1 / length of data axis
      NAXIS4  =                   1 / length of data axis
      CTYPE1  = 'RA---SIN'
      CRVAL1  =         139.5235701
      CRPIX1  =                 330
      CDELT1  =    -0.0004166666768
      CTYPE2  = 'DEC--SIN'
      CRVAL2  =      -12.0955450949
      CRPIX2  =                 328
      CDELT2  =     0.0004166666768
      PC1_1   =                   1
      PC1_2   =-1.7318465835227e-09
      PC2_1   = 1.7318465835227e-09
      PC2_2   =                   1
      CTYPE3  = 'FREQ    '
      CRVAL3  =        332902343.75
      CRPIX3  =                   1
      CDELT3  =           2490234.5
      CTYPE4  = 'STOKES  '
      CRVAL4  =                   1
      CRPIX4  =                   1
      CDELT4  =                   1



  This particular image had so-called ``degenerate axes'' added, which
  had the effect of increasing its dimensionality from 2 to 4. As such,
  this image may be rejected by some image display programs that expect
  a 2-d image. In fact,


           img = fits_read_img ("hydra.fits");
           wcs = fitswcs_get_img_wcs ("hydra.fits");



  will read the image as a Float_Type[1,1,657,657] object, and the WCS
  as a 4-d with wcs.ctype equal to


           ["STOKES", "FREQ", "DEC--SIN", "RA---SIN"]



  The degenerate dimensions may be removed from the image via


           img = img[0,0,*,*];



  producing a 2d image of type Float_Type[657,657]. The corresponding
  wcs may be obtained using the fitswcs_slice function to extract the
  last two dimensions of the WCS:



     wcs = fitswcs_slice (wcs, [2,3]);



  Another use of the fitswcs_slice is to reorder the dimensions of the
  WCS. For example, earlier it was pointed out that when constructing an
  image from columns in a table, that one read the WCS in a row-major
  order. If the reverse order was used when obtaining the WCS from the
  columns of a binary table, e.g.,


           wcs = fitswcs_get_column_wcs ("evt2.fits[EVENTS]", ["X", "Y"]);



  then it would have been necessary to reverse the order of the dimen-
  sions of the WCS structure. The fitswcs_slice may be used to swap the
  dimensions of the WCS, e.g.,


           wcs = fitswcs_slice (wcs, [1,0]);

  2.7.1.  fits_read_errmsgs


      Synopsis
        Retrieve all error messages from the CFITSIO error stack

      Usage
        String_Type[] fits_read_errmsgs ()

      Description
        This function returns all the error messages from the CFITSIO
        error message stack as an array of strings.

      Notes
        Using this function will cause the error message stack to be
        cleared.

      See Also
        ``_fits_read_errmsg'', ``fits_set_verbose_errors''


  2.7.2.  fits_set_verbose_errors


      Synopsis
        Set the verbosity level of the cfitsio error messages

      Usage
        fits_set_verbose_errors (Int_Type level)

      Description
        When a call to a function in the high-level interface fails, a
        error message will get generated. By default, all messages from
        the underlying cfitsio error stack are printed. This behavior
        may be turned off by calling this function with level equal to
        0.

      See Also
        ``fits_read_errmsgs''


  2.7.3.  fits_open_file


      Synopsis
        Open a fits file

      Usage
        Fits_File_Type fits_open_file (String_Type filename, String_Type
        mode)

      Description
        The fits_open_file function can be used to open and existing
        fits file for reading or updating, or to create a new fits file,
        depending upon the value of the mode parameter. Specifically, if
        mode is "r", the file will be opened for reading. If mode is
        "w", the file will be opened for updating (both reading and
        writing). Otherwise, mode must be "c", which indicates that a
        new file is to be created.  In the latter case, if a file
        already exists with the specified name, it will get deleted and
        a new one created in its place.

        If the function fails, it will signal an error; otherwise an
        open file pointer will be returned.

      See Also
        ``fits_close_file'', ``fits_create_binary_table''


  2.7.4.  fits_close_file


      Synopsis
        Close a fits file

      Usage
        fits_close_file (Fits_File_Type f)

      Description
        The fits_close_file closes a previously opened fits file. The
        function will signal an error if the operation fails.

      Notes
        This function could fail if it fails to write out any buffered
        data because of filesystem errors (disk full, etc.).

      See Also
        ``fits_open_file''


  2.7.5.  fits_move_to_interesting_hdu


      Synopsis
        Move to an extension that looks interesting

      Usage
        fits_move_to_interesting_hdu (fp [, hdu_type]

       Fits_File_Type fp;
       Int_Type hdu_type;



      Description
        The function move the fits file pointer fp forward to an HDU
        that looks interesting. By definition, an interesting HDU is one
        in which NAXIS is non-zero. The first parameter fp must be a
        pointer to an already open fits file. The second parameter, if
        present, may be used to specifiy the type of HDU, e.g., either
        an image (hdu_type=_FITS_IMAGE_HDU) or a binary table
        (hdu_type=_FITS_BINARY_TBL).

        If the function fails to find an interesting HDU of the
        appropriate type, an exception will be generated.

             Fits_File_Type or String_Type fd;
             String_Type key;



      Description
        The fits_key_exists function checks for the existence of a
        specified keyword in the file specified by the descriptor fd,
        which must specify the name of a file or an open file pointer.

        If the specified key exists, the function return 1, otherwise it
        returns 0.

      See Also
        ``fits_read_key'', ``fits_read_header''


  2.7.7.  fits_get_colnum


      Synopsis
        Get the column numbers of specified columns

      Usage
        column_num = fits_get_colnum (fd, column_name)


             Fits_File_Type or String_Type fd;
             String_Type column_name;



      Description
        This function returns the column number of the column with the
        specified name.  The file-descriptor fd must specify the name of
        a file, or an open fits file pointer.

        Int_Type fits_binary_table_column_exists (fd, col)


             Fits_File_Type or String_Type fd;
             String_Type col;



      Description
        This function may be used to determine whether or not a named
        column exists in a binary table. The table is specified via the
        fd parameter which must either be the name of a file containing
        the binary table, or an file pointer.

        If the specified column exists, 1 will be returned; otherwise
        the function will return 0.

      See Also
        ``fits_key_exists'', ``fits_open_file''


  2.7.9.  fits_read_col


      Synopsis
        Read one or more columns from a FITS binary table

      Usage
        (x1, ...xN) = fits_read_col (file, c1, ... cN)


             Fits_File_Type or String_Type file;
             Int_Type or String_Type c1, ...cN;



      Description
        This function returns one or more vectors containing objects in
        the specified columns of the binary table indicated by file. If
        file is a string, then the file will be opened via the virtual
        file specification implied by file. Otherwise, file should
        represent an already opened FITS file. The column parameters may
        either be strings denoting the column names, or integers
        representing the column numbers.

              String_Type col1, ...;



      Description
        This function works exactly like fits_read_col except it returns
        the values in a structure. See the documentation on that
        function for more information.

      Description
        This function returns the object in the column c and row r of
        the binary table indicated by file. If file is a string, then
        the file will be opened via the virtual file specification
        implied by file. Otherwise, file should represent an already
        opened FITS file.

      See Also
        ``fits_read_col'', ``fits_read_row''


  2.7.12.  fits_read_row

          Struct_Type sdata;
          Struct_Type skeys;
          Struct_Type hist;



      Description
        The fits_write_binary_table function creates a new binary table
        in the specified file. The parameter file specifies either a
        filename or an open file pointer. The extname parameter
        specifies the extension name of the binary table. The data
        written to table are specified in the sdata structure, where the
        name of the structure field specifies the column name. If skeys
        is non-NULL, then it is a structure indicating additional
        keywords to be written to the header of the binary table. If the
        optional parameter hist is present and non-NULL, then it is a
        structure whose fields indicate either comment or history
        information to be written to the header.

      Example
        The following code
              variable data = struct { x, cosx, sinx };
              data.x = [0:2*PI:0.01];
              data.cosx = cos(data.x);

              keys.hduname = "COSXSINX";
              keys.username = "John Doe";

              variable hist = struct { history, comment};
              hist.history = ["This is a history record", "This is another"];
              hist.comment = ["This is a comment", "And this is another"];

              fits_write_binary_table ("foo.fits", "COSXSINX", data, keys, hist);

        specifies the extension name of the image, or NULL for the
        primary image. The image data written to the file are specified
        by the image parameter.  If the optional parameter skeys is non-
        NULL, then it is a structure indicating additional keywords to
        be written to the HDU.  If the optional parameter hist is
        present and non-NULL, then it is a structure whose fields
        indicate either comment or history information to be written to
        the header.

        rearranging its axes or by using a subset of them. The dims
        argument specifies the dimensions to use.

      Example
        Suppose that wcs represents a 4 dimensional WCS. Then

         wcs2 = fitswcs_slice (wcs, [0,1]);



     will result in a 2 dimensional WCS from the first 2 axis of the
     input WCS.  Similarly,


              wcs2 = fitswcs_slice (wcs, [1,0]);



     will produce a 2d WCS with the first two axes swapped.

  2.8.3.  fitswcs_get_img_wcs


      Synopsis
        Read a WCS for a FITS image

      Usage
        wcs = fitswcs_get_img_wcs (fp [,alt])

      Description
        The fitswcs_get_img_wcs returns a structure representing a WCS
        from the specified file descriptor fp corresponding to an image
        HDU.  An optional parameter may be used to specified an
        alternate WCS.

      Example


             wcs = fitswcs_get_img_wcs ("img.fits[IMAGE]", 'P');

        ``fitswcs_get_vector_wcs''


  2.8.4.  fitswcs_get_column_wcs


      Synopsis
        Get the WCS attached to one or more columns of a binary table

      Usage
        fitswcs_get_column_wcs (fp, columns-array [,alt]

      Description
        This function may be used to obtain the WCS associated with one
        or more columns of a binary table. The file descriptor fp must
        specify a binary table. The columns-array parameter should be an
        array of columns names. The third parameter is optional and is
        used to specify an alternate WCS.


      Example


             wcs = fitswcs_get_column_wcs ("evt1.fits[EVENTS]", ["Y","X"]);



      Notes
        If the intent is to bin the data in the binary table columns,
        then it is best to specify the columns as ["Y", "X"] and not the
        other way around. This is because the slang routines that deal
        with images assumes that the slowest varying index corresponds
        to the first one, whereas FITS assumes the opposite.

  2.8.5.  fitswcs_get_vector_wcs


      Synopsis
        Get the WCS of an image in a specified table cell

      Usage
        wcs = fitswcs_get_vector_wcs (fp, column_name, row [,alt])

      Description
        This function reads the WCS of an image in a specified cell of a
        binary table given by fp parameter. The second and third
        parameters specify the column name and row number of the cell.
        An optional fourth parameter may be used to obtain the
        corresponding alternate WCS.

      Example
        This example reads the WCS associated with the image in the
        second row of the QEU column of the binary table with HDUNAME
        equal to AXAF_QEU1 in the file "HRCQEU.fits":


              wcs = fitswcs_get_vector_wcs ("HRCQEU.fits[AXAF_QEU1], "QEU", 2);



      Notes
        The current implementation does not yet support references to
        the WCS of other cells.

        from the X and Y columns in a file, and the construct a
        corresponding WCS:


              (x,y) = fits_read_col ("table.fits", "X", "Y");
              gridx = [min(x):max(x):0.5];
              gridy = [min(y):max(y):0.5];
              img = hist2d (y,x,gridy,gridx);

             U0,X0: 1-d arrays
                 A: 2-d array (or 1-d array representing a diagonal matrix)



      Description
        This function may be used to create a new WCS by applying a
        linear transformation to an existing one. This is useful when
        one has a WCS associated with physical coordinates X, and then
        applies the linear transformation


               U = U0 + A#(X-X0)



     to the coordinates X. Then corresponding WCS for the resulting
     image is given by


               new_wcs = fitswcs_linear_transform_wcs (wcs, U0, A, X0);



      Notes

  3.  The low-level interface



  3.1.  Overview



  Functions in the low-level module are usually needed when it is
  necessary to perform some task that is not readily achievable using
  the high-level interface. This module may be loaded using


           require ("cfitsio");



  When mixing functions from both interfaces, it is not necessary to
  explicitly load the cfitsio module in this manner since it is loaded
  automatically by the high-level interface.

  For the most part, for those functions that have been wrapped, the
  cfitsio module represents a 1-1 mapping between the functions of the
  cfitsio library and those of the module. For this reason a detailed
  description of the functions in the cfitsio module will not be given
  here; the reader is referred to the documentation for the CFITSIO
  library itself for the details. Here only the semantic differences
  between the functions in the module and those of the library, and how
  the functions are documented.

  Most CFITSIO functions adhere to a so-called ``inherited status''
  convention via a ``status'' argument as the last parameter. In
  addition functions also return the error status as a return value.
  For simplicity the wrapping by the module does not respect this
  convention. That is, none of the module's functions take a status
  argument. For example, the CFITSIO documentation for the
  fits_get_num_hdus specifies that it is to be called from C via:


           status = fits_get_num_hdus (fptr, &hdunum, &status);



  This function has been wrapped such that it is to be called from S-
  lang via


          status = _fits_get_num_hdus (fptr, &hdunum);



  3.2.  Low-level Function Reference



  3.2.1.  _fits_get_errstatus


      Synopsis
        Retrieve a text string corresponding to an error code

      Usage
        String_Type _fits_get_errstatus (Int_Type status)

      Description
        This function is a wrapper around the cfitsio library function
        fits_get_errstatus. See its documentation for additional
        information.

      See Also
        ``fits_read_errmsgs'', ``_fits_read_errmsg''



  3.2.2.  _fits_read_errmsg


      Synopsis
        Retrieve an error message from the cfitsio error message stack

      Usage
        String_Type _fits_read_errmsg ()

      Description
        This function is a wrapper around the cfitsio library function
        fits_read_errmsg. See its documentation for additional
        information.

      Notes
        This function returns NULL if there are no error messages
        available.

      See Also
        ``fits_read_errmsgs'', ``fits_set_verbose_errors''



  3.2.3.  _fits_open_file


      Synopsis
        Open a fits file

      Usage
        status = _fits_open_file (Ref_Type fptr, String_Type file,
        String_Type mode)

      Description
        This function is a wrapper around the cfitsio library function
        fits_open_file. See its documentation for additional
        information.

        The main difference between this function and its cfitsio
        counterpart is that the mode argument is a string whose value
        must be one of the following:


              "r"     Open the file in read-only mode
              "w"     Open the file in read-write mode
              "c"     Create a new file.

     Note that if the mode argument is "c", then the cfitsio fits_cre-
     ate_file function will be called. An important difference between
     this intrinsic function and the fits_create_file library function
     is that if the file already exists, the library function will
     return an error, whereas _fits_open_file will simply delete the
     file before creating a new one.



  3.2.4.  _fits_delete_file


      Synopsis

        fits_close_file. See its documentation for additional
        information.



  3.2.6.  _fits_movabs_hdu


      Synopsis
        Move to an absolute HDU number

      Usage
        status = _fits_movabs_hdu (Fits_File_Type fptr, Int_Type hdunum)

        This function is a wrapper around the cfitsio library function
        fits_movabs_hdu. See its documentation for additional
        information.

      Notes
        The cfitsio counterpart also returns the HDU type of the
        resulting HDU.



  3.2.7.  _fits_movrel_hdu


      Synopsis
        Move a relative number of HDUs
      Usage
        status = _fits_movrel_hdu (Fits_File_Type fptr, Int_Type nmove)

        Move to a named HDU

      Usage
        status = _fits_movnam_hdu (fptr, hdutype, extname, extvers)

             Int_Type hdutype, extvers;
             String_Type extname;



      Description
        This function is a wrapper around the cfitsio library function
        fits_movnam_hdu. See its documentation for additional
        information.

        Fits_File_Type outfptr)

      Description
        This function is a wrapper around the cfitsio library function

             Array_Type dims;



      Description
        This function is a wrapper around the cfitsio library function
        fits_create_img. See its documentation for additional
        information.

      Notes
        This function differs from the corresponding cfitsio function in
        that the dims array is assumed to be a 1-d integer array whose
        elements specify the number of axes and the size of each axis.
        In particular, the value of the NAXIS keyword will be given by
        length(dims), the value of NAXIS1 will be given by dims[0], and
        so forth.



  3.2.17.  _fits_write_img


      Synopsis
        Write an image

        This function is a wrapper around the cfitsio library function
        fits_read_img. See its documentation for additional information.

      Notes
        This function differs from the corresponding cfitsio routine in
        that the type of the image returned is automatically determined
        by the routine via a call to fits_get_img_type. The
        dimensionality of the returned image is given by
        [...,NAXIS2,NAXIS1] such that NAXIS1 corresponds to the fastest
        varying dimension, NAXIS2 the next fastest varying, etc.



  3.2.19.  _fits_create_binary_tbl


      Synopsis
        Create a binary table extension

      Usage

             Int_Type naxis2;
             String_Type extname;



      Notes
        The _fits_create_binary_tbl function is a wrapper around the
        fits_create_tbl function explicitly creating a binary table.
        The input arrays ttype, tform, and tunit must be the same
        length, which determines the number of columns in the table. The
        tunit and extname parameters may be set to NULL.



  3.2.20.  _fits_update_key


      Synopsis
        Update a keyword or append a new one

      Usage
        status = _fits_update_key (fptr, keyname, value, comment)


             Fits_File_Type fptr;
             String_Type keyname, comment;
             Any_Type value;



      Description
        This function is a wrapper around the cfitsio library function
        fits_update_key. See its documentation for additional
        information.

      Notes
        The data-type for the value argument must be an approriate type
        for FITS keywords. If value is a string, then the string will be
        written as a cfitsio long-string using the
        fits_update_key_longstr function. If value is NULL, then the
        fits_update_key_null function will be called to update the
        keyword.

        The comment parameter may be set to NULL to if the comment field
        associated with the keyword is not to be modified.

        To update the value of a boolean (logical) keyword, use the
        _fits_update_logical function.

      Description
        This function is a complicated wrapper around a number of
        cfitsio functions to enable it to read any type of column,
        including vector and variable length columns. The data read by
        the function is assigned as the appropriately typed array to the
        variable referenced by the array argument.

        For ordinary scalar columns, a 1-d array of size numrows will be
        produced. For a vector column, a 2d array of size
        [numrows,repeat] will be generated. Here repeat is given by the
        repeat value associated with the column. For a variable length
        column, where data are stored in the heap of the HDU, the data
        will be read as a 1-d array of numrows arrays.

        If the column is a bit-valued column, then data will be returned
        as an array of integers of the appropriate size. Currently only
        8X, 16X, and 32X bit columns are supported.

             Array_Type colnums;
             Int_Type firstrow, numrows;
             Ref_Type arrays;



      Description
        This function performs a similar task as the _fits_read_col.
        The main difference is that instead of reading a single column,
        it is capable of reading multiple columns specified by the
        colnums parameter. It assigns the data as an array of arrays to
        the variable referenced by the arrays parameter. See the
        documentation for the _fits_read_col function for more
        information.
