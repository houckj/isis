Changes since 1.6.2 (released Jan 2012)
---------------------------------------
 1.  Autogenerate code for xspec-module at configure time.
 2.  Retrieve literature references from atomdb "ionrec" files.
 3.  Update xspec module code generator for heasoft-6.12 release.
 4.  Fix energy level label truncation bug.  AtomDB energy level
     labels now contain spaces.  However, the code assumed that
     there were no embedded spaces, so the labels were being wrongly
     truncated at the first embedded space.
 5.  Add support parametrized software RMFs with fittable parameters
     (for calibration work).
 6.  Add assign_back, unassign_back
 7.  Xspec module was sometimes linking to the wrong library symbol
 8.  New load_data qualifier supports loading BACKGROUND_UP/DOWN columns
 9.  Introduce more consistent model definition for flux-corrected data
     (see fit_flux).
10.  Support setting per-dataset minimum stat_err via load_data qualifier
11.  Fix bug associated with change #9 above (variable sometimes
     uninitialized)
12.  Fix indexing bug associated with handling ignore/notice in
     change #9 above.
13.  get_fit_statistic was returning NULL for slang fit statistics
14.  Fix definition of maximum likelihood statistic introduced in
     1.6.1-38
15.  'errorbars' should control plotting of error bars in
     rplot_counts and rplot_flux
16.  Update xspec module for heasoft-6.13/xspec-12.8 release.
17.  Explicitly link Fortran libraries to avoid run-time link
     error on new Mac OS X systems.
18.  New access functions: get_back_model, get_back_data,
     get_back_data_scale_factor
19.  conf_loop fits flux-corrected data when 'flux' qualifier
     is present
20.  Support fit statistic with explicit dependence on background
     (e.g. wstat)
21.  Bug-fix: When several different models were defined using
     set_par_fun to assign a different function to the same
     parameter index in each model (e.g. param #5 in each
     model), the parameter functions assigned to that index
     weren't always being restored correctly upon each switch
     to a previously defined fit-function.  This happened
     because the names chosen for the corresponding
     auto-generated temporary S-Lang functions were not
     sufficiently varied (making function name collisions quite
     likely under these conditions).  With this fix, the
     temporary function names include an md5 checksum and so
     are (almost) certain to be unique.
22.  Warn about using non-chi-square fit statistic with mpfit/lmdif.
23.  Modify implementation of #21 to improve back-compatibility.
24.  Update cfitsio module.
25.  Fix back-compatibility issue from #23. Sigh.
26.  Modify configure script to ensure RPATH is set on Mac OS X.
27.  Code cleanup to eliminate compiler warnings;
     drop modules/xspec/src/xspec-compat.inc
28.  Removed half-pixel offset in contour plots.  This offset
     was introduced in 1.0.9 to workaround a bug (change #42
     following the 1.0.8 release), but the workaround is
     apparently no longer needed.
29.  cache_fun now supports caching of operator models.
30.  Updates to support heasoft-6.16
31.  Updates to support heasoft-6.17
32.  Regarding BACKGROUND_UP/DOWN, changed background definition
     from:
      back = BACKGROUND_UP/BACKSCUP + BACKGROUND_DOWN/BACKSCDN
     to:
      back = (BACKGROUND_UP + BACKGROUND_DOWN)
             /(BACKSCUP + BACKSCDN)
32.Mh1. Fix option string update for fit-method "simann".
32.td1. Fix a bug when parsing the lmodel.dat file and loading 
        local models
33.  Merge 32.Mh1, 32.td1 changes into main isis distribution.
     Added pgtick wrapper; updated copyright notices and load_rmf
     documentation.
34.  src/db-atomic.c: Change int variable to size_t to avoid integer
     overflow when loading full atomdb-v3.0.3
35.  src/db-cie.c: Increase DEFAULT_HASH_TABLE_SIZE_HINT to better
     handle larger line list in atomdb-v3.0.3
36.  src/db-atomic.c: Change int variable to size_t to avoid integer
     overflow when loading atomdb
37.  Updates to support heasoft-6.20
38.  Use fits_read_key_longstr to read file paths for RESPFILE,
     ANCRFILE, BACKFILE keywords.
39.  xspec module: new lmodel keyword for load_xspec_local_models,
     build_xspec_local_models.  Also, update etc/aped.sl to read
     a versioned ionization balance filename.
40.  xspec module supports xspec_rename_model_hook to rename
     xspec models provided to isis.
41.  Updates to support heasoft-6.23

Changes since 1.6.1 (released Jul 2010)
---------------------------------------
 1.  get_params now works with regular expressions, for example:
         p = get_params ("mekal(1).*");
 2.  xspec module cleanup.  Fortran name mangling scheme now
     determined at configure time.
 3.  save_input now takes a File_Type pointer
 4.  Some isis intrinsics were previously available under two
     names, one deprecated.  The following deprecated names
     have been removed: iback_fun, _define_bgd, define_bgd. The
     corresponding supported names are: back_fun, _define_back,
     define_back.
 5.  The path to a site-local setup script can now be specified
     at configure time using --with-local-setup=FILE.  The
     specified FILE will be automatically loaded at isis
     startup.
 6.  Add --with-xspec-modelsonly configure option
 7.  Contours overplotted on a subset of a 2D array were being
     plotted incorrectly.
 8.  Don't generate an error when a model parameter value,
     obtained from a function evaluation, falls outside the
     assigned min/max range (see set_par_fun). Instead, the out
     of range value will be ignored and a warning message will
     be printed if Isis_Verbose>0.
 9.  Revise error handling introduced in #8 to interrupt
     model evaluation when derived parameters are out of range.
10.  eval_fun2 wasn't validating the fitfun reference before
     attempting to use it.
11.  mpfit exit status was not being signaled correctly.
12.  Support for updated aped database.
13.  Support simultaneously loading multiple spectroscopy databases.
     New intrinsics:  db_push, db_list, db_select
14.  Plot energy levels with missing LS quantum numbers.
15.  line_info returns more energy level details
16.  create_aped_fun now supports user-defined ionization balance
     (create_aped_ionpop_modifier, aped_ionpop_modifier_args).
17.  Fix array indexing bug in ionpop modifier introduced in #16
18.  Added xspec_noneq() function.
19.  Don't generate NaN when ion fraction rescaling involves 0/0.
20.  Updated cfitsio module to version 0.4.7
21.  Change #13 moved the slang print function into the _isis
     namespace.  It should be in the isis namespace.
22.  Setting parameter min=max=0 means "unlimited range" but
     that setting should respect the hard limits.
23.  conf_map_counts provides new a 'flood' algorithm (contributed
     by Manfred Hanke and Moritz BÃ¶ck).  The 'flood' algorithm
     traverses the 2D parameter region by expanding away from the
     best fit point, taking initial free parameter values from
     a nearby fit.  In contrast, the default algorithm performs a
     raster scan of the 2D region, taking initial free parameter
     values from the best fit point.
24.  Support passing qualifiers to fit-functions implemented in slang
25.  array_fit should not assume input parameters are Double_Type
26.  New intrinsics __rline_init_tty, __rline_reset_tty will be
     used by readline in an upcoming slang release.
27.  Support AREASCAL keyword (AREASCAL column was already supported)
28.  Get more versatile 'unique' function from slsh:setfuns.sl
29.  pileup kernel wasn't properly evaluating dataset-specific models
30.  regroup_file: improve OGIP standard compliance.
31.  New --stkchk command-line option invokes S-Lang stack checker
32.  Parallel conf map calculation could start too many slaves.
33.  The structure returned by get_combined2 now contains a
     spectral grid and the data values are unpacked.
34.  plot_conf now supports user-specified contour colors.
35.  Pileup kernel will now generate an error if used with
     an rsp matrix; the response must be factored into separate
     arf and rmf components.
36.  Remove xspec11 legacy table model code;  the xspec12 library
     has provided the identical interface since March 2010.
37.  Choose more sensible confmap parameter grids.
38.  Add Poisson maximum likelihood statistic "ml"
39.  Fix memory leak associated with xspec local models
40.  Restore etable model support to xspec module (add_etable_model)
41.  Update xspec module to match heasoft-6.11/xspec-12.7
42.  Update atomdb regression test for atomdb-v2.0.1 release
43.  add_slang_statistic now provides delta_is_chisqr qualifier
44.  list_par prints function name even when there are no parameters
45.  Provide xspec_config_hook
46.  Fix bug in apec spectral models introduced in 1.6.1-19
     (Oct 2010). This bug removed the relative abundance
     scaling factor from continuum spectral components in apec
     spectral models defined using create_aped_fun.  As a
     result, continuum components in these models were always
     included with the default cosmic abundance. A new
     regression test has been added to prevent any future
     reoccurrence of this problem.
47.  Added __set_fitfun_trace_hook
48.  To avoid fortran global namespace collisions, prefixed
     all internal isis fortran symbols with 'isis_'.
49.  xspec_abund wasn't working with user-defined abundance tables.
50.  Simplify xspec model symbol lookup.
51.  fork_slaves, manage_slaves provide more control options
     through new qualifiers.
52.  New parallel_map function.
53.  Update configure and install instructions to support
     MacOS 10.7 (Lion)
54.  Change interface of fit_counts, renorm_counts, fit_flux,
     renorm_flux to use a qualifier instead of an optional
     function parameter to select response_type, e.g. Ideal_ARF
55.  set_par supports setting min/max via qualifiers
56.  Apply patch from John E. Davis to fix floating point overflow
     bug in pileup kernel
57.  When running in parallel, conf_loop should have been passing
     all parameters between master and slave processes and not just
     the selected parameters.

Changes since 1.6.0 (released Apr 2010)
---------------------------------------
 1.  xspec module more closely adheres to local model naming convention
 2.  Fixed NULL dereference bug (copy_covariance_matrix)
 3.  array_fit: internally, force 'pars' to be an array and don't
     overwrite it on return.
 4.  A list of summed spectra and models associated with combine_datasets
     is now stored internally.  See get_combined2.
 5.  Provided a means to modify data and model spectra immediately
     before they are summed by combine_datasets. See set_pre_combine_hook.
 6.  set_sys_err_frac now accepts a scalar value
 7.  Error bars in histogram plots now include systematic error
     added in quadrature.
 8.  Added slang rmf support (contributed by John E. Davis).
 9.  Added 0.5 pixel correction to reference coordinate in confmap
     WCS header (contributed by Manfred Hanke).
10.  Added support for response, flux qualifiers to all routines
     that perform forward folding including conf, conf_loop, etc.
11.  New intrinsics: set_rebin_error_method, get_rebin_error_hook
12.  Changed set_hard_limits to __set_hard_limits
       * arbitrary changes to hard limits are now supported
       * hard limits can be changed either for a specific instance
         of a model or for the default configuration of a model.
         In the latter case, all subsequent instances of the model
         will be affected.
13.  Fix parameter table vs. dataset list synchronization bug.
14.  set_par should respect tied parameters.
15.  Improved synchronization between dataset list and fit parameter list.
16.  set_par() should warn about attempts to change tied parameters;
     set_params should be able to create/destroy parameter ties
17.  Revert part of #16 - set_par once again silently ignores
     attempts to change tied parameters.
18.  Fix bug introduced by recent changes to handling of tied
     parameters:  load_par/edit_par can once again untie parameters.
     Added a regression test to make sure this feature doesn't get
     broken again.
19.  conf_loop now defaults to operating on all free parameters.
     Setting Fit_Verbose<0 now reduces verbosity during a fit.
20.  create_aped_fun: elemental abundance parameter names now have
     'abund_' prefix.  Use qualifier 'no_abund_prefix' to drop this
     prefix (for back-compatibility).
21.  set_par was not modifying 'step'
22.  The set_par interface was modified so that the absolute
     initial parameter step size, 'step', is now specified
     using a qualifier.  A 'relstep' qualifier was added
     to enable setting the relative parameter step size.
     The 'relstep' value may be obtained using get_par_info()
     and get_params(). It may also be set using set_params().

     mpfit was previously configured to use an initial relative
     parameter step size of 1% (e.g. relstep=0.01). This is a
     bad choice for fits where the min/max range is smaller
     than 1% of the parameter value and also for parameters
     constrained to better than 1% by the available data. The
     fitted center position of strong emission lines in high
     quality grating data falls into this latter category.

     The default relstep value used by mpfit is now specified
     on a per-parameter basis and may be user-specified.
     For xspec functions, the default is set by the intrinsic
     variable Isis_Default_Relstep, which defaults to 1.e-4.

28.  Added mpfit optimization method.  Removed lmdif, providing
     a backward-compatible lmdif interface that invokes mpfit.
29.  Fix bug in array_fit interface (par_step passed as NULL)

pre1.5.0
 1.  Added support for parallel processing via fork and select.
     New functions:  new_slave_list, fork_slave, append_slave,
                     manage_slaves, send_msg, recv_msg,
                     read_array, write_array
 2.  Parallelized conf_map_counts and conf_map_flux.
     On multi-core machines, these functions use all available
     cores by default.  See the documentation for details.

38.  Update xspec module to support changes new with xspec-12.5.0.
39.  New cache_fun() and alias_fun() intrinsics, contributed
     by Mike Noble, Mike Nowak and Manfred Hanke.
     cache_fun() enables caching of spectral models, reducing
     redundant model evaluations during e.g. confidence limit searches.
     alias_fun() enables renaming spectral models and model
     parameters and changing parameter defaults.
40.  Applied patch to retrieve help files using the S-Lang
     add_doc_file() intrinsic (from Mike Noble)
41.  Added support for displaying xspec12 help files, either pdf
     or html.
42.  Improved support for xspec12 local models
43.  At the isis prompt, __argc,__argv now contains the full input

     access to APED database literature references.
51.  New function, aped_fun_details, provides access to
     individual emission line flux contributions from each
     temperature-density component of every spectral model component
52.  New functions, aped_line_modifier_args, aped_line_profile_args,
     aped_hook_args simplify eval_fun2 evaluation of aped
     functions
53.  Updated cfitsio module to get fix for reading vector string
     columns
54.  PHA file input now looks for the hdu with EXTNAME=SPECTRUM,
     instead of moving to hdu=2.
55.  Support BACKFILE keyword in Type I pha files.  To ignore
     this keyword, set Ignore_PHA_Backfile_Keyword=1.
     Also, Isis_List_Filenames now defaults to 1.
56.  Added support for optimization methods implemented in slang.
     See new intrinsics register_slang_optimizer and open_fit.

Changes since 1.4.8 (released Sept 2007)
---------------------------------------
 1.  If a script contains an isis_main() function, isis will
     execute that function and exit. If the --force-interactive
     option is used, isis will prompt for input after executing
     isis_main().  Executable scripts can now use
           #! /usr/bin/env isis
     isis-script is no longer required.
 2.  Added support for the S-Lang debugger.  Use the --sldb
     command-line option to invoke the debugger.
 3.  Added support for the S-Lang profiler.  Use the --prof
     command-line option to invoke the profiler.

10.  Reorganized xspec module build/install logic
11.  Added xspec 12 model list to the source code distribution
     (it's no longer necessary to run the xspec module code
     generator to use isis with xspec 12.)
12.  Improved performance of APED spectral models that use a line modifier
13.  isis-script --sldb foo.sl runs isis_main automatically.
14.  Fixed assign_rsp bug.  First listed RMF was not re-defining
     the dataset grid when multiple RMFs were assigned to one dataset.
15.  All internal pgplot calls now use the pgplot module.
16.  Removed obsolete gpileup kernel module.

 4.  Models for flux-corrected data should not include the
     instrumental background.
 5.  If present, rebin_error_hook manages error propagation
     associated with the background (see set_rebin_error_hook).
 6.  Added support for AREASCAL column in PHA files.
 7.  APED spectral models now support user-defined modification
     of line emissivity functions, with fittable parameters.
     See the create_aped_fun() documentation for details.

 5.  Prompt text is ignored if it appears as a prefix on the
     command line in interactive mode.
 6.  Fixed bug in application of optional weights in combine_datasets.

     (regroup_file, use_file_group, i2x_group, x2i_group)
     along with new intrinsic variable, Isis_Use_PHA_Grouping.

     and flags are now specified with FC and FCFLAGS instead of
     F77 and FFLAGS.

Changes since 1.4.3 (released Jan 2007)
---------------------------------------
 1.  Error handling uses S-Lang exceptions more consistently
 2.  Installation procedure should be simpler.
 3.  fit_flux is independent of the fit-kernel.

Changes since 1.4.2 (released Sep 2006)

 3.  flux_corr skips ignored data
 4.  xspec.sl is idempotent
 5.  Static-linking the xspec module works again.
 6.  Added get_outer_viewport, set_outer_viewport.
     ** Note that in the past, the low-level pgplot function
        _pgsvp was often used to set the viewport for plots
        created using isis intrinsic plot functions.  With this
        change, _pgsvp will no longer have the desired effect
        on these plots. Use set_outer_viewport instead of _pgsvp.
 7.  Changed handling of command-line arguments by isis-script.
     Scripts no longer intercept command line arguments supported
     by isis.
 8.  Removed -l command-line option.

Changes since 1.4.1 (released Sep 2006)

     counts is small.

Changes since 1.3.3 (released Apr 2006)
---------------------------------------
 1.  Added eval_fun2() to support evaluating a fit-function

 5.  Operator functions should now be invoked as
      operator(id, operand(k)) instead of
      operator(operand(k), id)
     In other words, the integer index should be the first
     argument.
 6.  Fit-functions can now take arbitrary additional parameters.
     For example, something like this:
        fit_fun ("foo(1, &bar, array, baz(1))");

 5.  Added support for comment header in fit-model parameter files
     (comment lines have long been supported, just not as a
     header, preceding the model definition line).
 6.  pgplot module intrinsics are working again on Mac OS X.
 7.  Uncertainties computed for background-subtracted, rebinned,
     flux-corrected data now properly includes the background

     keywords in PHA file headers.  Default value is zero.
11.  New intrinsic variable Rmf_OGIP_Compliance.
     If zero, isis will require less strict adherence to the
     OGIP standard format for RMFs.
12.  Update cfitsio module;  new version includes many
     improvements and greatly expanded documentation.
13.  Update pgplot module;  the handling of 2D arrays changed.

     varied during the fit.  With the bug-fix, the free parameter
     is varied correctly.
 9.  New function mt_create_from_struct()

Changes since 1.1.8 (released Feb 2004)
---------------------------------------
 1. set_rebin_error_hook(id,NULL) now works as it should

 3. Added _phabs to xspec-module; _wabs now returns wabs
    instead of phabs.
 4. Resolved ambiguity in definition of model_flux by
    introducing "convolved_model_flux".  Now, model_flux
    always means \int dE S(E) -- the physical spectrum model
    integrated over the bin width.  The convolved_model_flux
    is this function folded through the RMF, \int dE R(h,E)S(E),
    and is useful primarily when dealing with flux-corrected
    data.  Functions have been provided to get, plot and
    oplot this quantity.
 5. Added optimization to improve performance when fitting
    multiple datasets with overlapping wavelength grids.
    See set_eval_grid_method().

----------------------------------------
 1. flux_corr_model_counts() now populates the model_flux
    rather than the data_flux.

    window and then opening a plot window could cause a segv.
 3. interpol() wasn't extrapolating properly.

Changes since 1.1.5 (released Aug 2003)
----------------------------------------
 1. Changed definition of reverse indices for both
    histogram and histogram2d.  The dimensions of the
    histogram2d result now match the input grid sizes.

 4. Added all_arfs() and all_rmfs() functions.
 5. rplot_counts()/rplot_flux() is now consistent with the
    current fit-statistic.  This required a change in the
    interface for user-defined fit-statistics.
 6. list_data and list_arf optionally show data filenames;
    filenames also available via get_data_info.  Related new
    intrinsic variable is 'Isis_List_Filenames'.

#######################################################################
#######################################################################

Changes to pre-release 1.0:
--------------------------
    * improve conf_[o]plot
    * add support for handling fit-parameters by name
       (see set_par() and related functions)
    * add --with-lheasoft config option to support
      statically linking the xspec module
    * added --disable-xspec_tables config option
    * support default parameter values for user-defined
      functions
    * add load_dataset() function to simply common
      sequence of load_data/arf/rmf, assign_arf/rmf
    * support assign_rmf() to grouped data
    * fixed minor bug in conf-limits convergence test;
      should now converge better
    * better pileup regression test (from John Davis)

(the last pre-1.0 version was 0.9.86)

Changes since 0.9.60
    * Added ignore_en(), notice_en(), xnotice_en()
    * Added readcol() and writecol()
    * Added fconf(), vfconf()

    * Added isis_add_help_hook()
    * Added isis_set_pager(), isis_get_pager();
    * Wrote a code-generator which automatically generates ISIS
      bindings for all additive and multiplicative models in XSPEC.
      To avoid conflicts with the XSPEC names, two ISIS intrinsic
      fit-function names were changed:
        __OLD_name___NEW_name___

    * Added mpane() function to select plot panes
    * Changed the way uncertainties are computed for
      rebinned, flux-corrected data when the counts
      are available.  Now, isis uses
            flux_err = flux * stat_err/counts.
      The previous method of setting flux_err to 1.0 in
      zero-count bins and adding flux_errs in quadrature
      over-estimated the uncertainty, particularly for
      low-count data.
    * Added set_fit_range_hook()
    * Included some regression tests in the distribution
    * documented get_params, set_params functions
    * get_data_info() now returns an array of structs.

      documentation (only one was previously documented..)
        get_hist_exposure  => get_data_exposure
        get_hist_backscale  => get_data_backscale
        set_hist_exposure  => set_data_exposure

    * documented rebin_dataset(), rebin_rmf() functions
    * Added save_input() function

      confidence contours (see conf_map_counts, conf_map_flux,
      conf_[o]plot, conf_joint)
    * Added latex2pg() function to support annotating plots
      with LaTeX-format strings.

      better formatted emission line labels in spectrum plots
    * Added egauss() fit-function
    * More xspec models: mtable, etable
    * Changed "regrid" => "rebin"
    * Added Isis_Residual_Plot_Type intrinsic variable to
      control residual plots (see rplot_counts/rplot_flux)
    * Added rebin_array() function.
    * More xspec models: pexrav, pexriv, laor, bknpower
    * Fit-parameter values may now be defined as functions of
      other fit-parameters.  See set_par_fun().
    * User-defined fit-functions may now evaluate differently
      for different datasets.  See Isis_Active_Dataset.
    * Added append_model() function
    * Changed model_spectrum() interface to support selecting
      lines-only or continuum-only
    * Added Cash statistic plus alternate forms of Chi-square.
    * Added support for user-defined fit-statistics written
      in S-Lang.  See add_slang_statistic()
    * Removed 'force' option from assign_arf().
    * Added support for multiple responses per data set
      (e.g. for LETG multi-order fitting). See assign_rsp().
    * flux_corr() is now more precise -- see manual.
    * duplicate line BUG fixed:
      When both the wavelength tables and line emissivity
      tables were loaded from the APEC 1.01 database, lines
      which had an observed wavelength "WAVE_OBS" value
      were listed twice in the input line list.

Changes since 0.9.51
    * Added the histogram() function for creating 1-D histograms.
    * Added the trans() filter for the Spectroscopy database

    * Updated FITS i/o module.
    * Added all_data() utility function.
    * Added rplot_counts(), rplot_flux() to simplify
      plotting residuals
    * Added improved background handling -- See define_bgd()
      and _define_bgd() functions.

      reading commands from stdin and bypassing
      readline.

Changes since 0.9.47
    * Added define_model() function
    * Added 'subplex' as alternative to the Levenburg-
      Marquardt minimization algorithm.
    * Modified Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm to
      fall back on Singular Value Decomposition if
      LU-Decomposition fails (LU decomp. is faster
      and works most of the time).
    * Added support for user-defined fit-methods and
      fit-statistics using code contributed by
      John Davis <davis@space.mit.edu>
    * Added define_arf(), get_arf_info(), set_arf_info()

    * Two Important Plotting Changes:

      1) The handling of multi-pane plots has changed.
      The new implementation automatically shifts the plot
      focus to the next pane each time a new plot is
      created.  This simplifies creating postscript
      files which contain multiple pages of plots.
      However, it is no longer easy to access plot panes
      in random order using the 'pane' function.
      As a result, the 'pane' function has been removed,
      although similar functionality is available from
      the low-level PGPLOT function '_pgpanl'.

      2) A new function 'multiplot' has been added to
      simplify creating plots with multiple panes sharing
      a common X-axis.

Changes since 0.9.30
    * Added zgauss, vphabs, mkcflow to xspec-module
    * Fixed bug in flux_corr -- ignored intervals weren't
      properly handled since the gpileup kernel was added
    * Added zwabs, zpowerlaw, diskline to xspec-module
    * updated XSPEC module to maintain compatibility with
      lheasoft_v5.1.0/xspec_v11.1.0

    * Added rebin_rmf() from John Davis <davis@space.mit.edu>
    * Generalized RMF and PHA file handling to support XMM data
    * Added comptt, smedge to xspec-module.
    * Added set_data_info function
    * Added support for non-square, delta-function RMFs [obscure, no?]
    * Fixed bug in parameter handling - models with duplicate
      functions weren't handled properly (e.g. gauss(1)+gauss(1)).
    * Fixed bug in tie() function - order of index arguments was reversed.
    * Added define_counts/define_flux functions

Changes since 0.9.11:

    * Important Change:

       The following functions now return an error code:

             fit_counts, fit_flux,
             eval_counts, eval_flux,
             renorm_counts, renorm_flux

       See the manual for details.

       This was an important change to allow fitting scripts to
       run more smoothly and is a significant improvement over the
       earlier implementation.

       However, this change may require you to modify your fitting
       scripts. Here is one quick way to update your scripts to
       simply ignore the new return code:

            perl -p -i -e "s|fit_flux|() = fit_flux|" *.sl
            perl -p -i -e "s|eval_flux|() = eval_flux|" *.sl
            perl -p -i -e "s|renorm_flux|() = renorm_flux|" *.sl
            perl -p -i -e "s|fit_counts|() = fit_counts|" *.sl
            perl -p -i -e "s|eval_counts|() = eval_counts|" *.sl
            perl -p -i -e "s|renorm_counts|() = renorm_counts|" *.sl

      fit-functions and fit-parameters.
    * Tuned hash function to speed line table lookups
